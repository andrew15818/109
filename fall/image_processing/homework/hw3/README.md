# Image Processing Homework Assignment 3
In this assignment, we have to compare and contrast multiple 
image compression methods, such as:
- **Huffman encoding**: We take the image, make a tree where we assign a 
specific code to the intensity levels, and then replace the values in the 
image with the shortened codes. I store the image as a series of strings with 
the assigned codes, which I think will take up more space.
- Block Based DCT
- Chromatic Subsampling
- Run-length encoding
- Predictive coding
- Quantization of DCT coefficients
