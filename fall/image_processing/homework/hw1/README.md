# Image Processing Homework 1
For this assignment, we have to write a program that enhances the input files using the 
techniques of **contrast adjustment**, **noise reduction**, **color correction**, "and so on...".

The way I'm thinking about the classes right now involves having a main `ImageProcessing` class
which can apply the different methods to the images. In the `ImageProcessing` class, we could
pass a string with the filename and a string with the name of the method?
