# Probability

We are concerned with talking about the variatons that occur 
in regular processes.
These all occur in a **sample space**, which refers to the set of
all possible outcomes from a process or an experiment.

There are many different possible outcomes from the sample space.
There is the **union**, **intersection** and **complement** of 
different events.

there are two different interpretations of probability: the one where we
assign our degree of belief to an event, and one where
we discuss the relative frequency in previous events.

The probability of a certain outcome from a set of possible
outcomes can be calculated by the sum of the individual probabilities.
This is kind of like saying that the probability $p_{1}$ or $p_{2}$....
$p_{n}$ = $\sum_{i=1}^{i=n}p_{i}(x)$.
