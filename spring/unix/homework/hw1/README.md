# Implement a 'lsof'-like program
In this homework, you have to implement the 'lsof' tool by yourself. 'lsof' is a tool to list open files. It can be used to list all the files opened by processes running in the system. The output of your homework is required to strictly follow the spec, the TAs will use the 'diff' tool to compare your output directly against our prepared sample sample testdata. Spaces and tabs are compressed into a single character when comparing the outputs.

A sample output from this homework is demonstrated as follows:
```sh
$ ./hw1  -c bash
bash

```
The detailed spec of this homework is introduced as follows. Your program has to output the following fields (columns) for each file opened by a running process. Each line presents the information for a single file. The required fields include COMMAND, PID, USERM, FD, TYPE, NODE, and NAME. The meaning of each field (column) is introduced below.

`COMMAND`:
The executable filename of a running process.
DO NOT show arguments.
`PID`:
Process id of a running process.
Only need to handle opened files in process level (check /proc/[pid]. No need to handle opened files in thread level (that would be in /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]).
`USER`:
The username who run the process.
Please show username instead of UID.
`FD`: The file descriptor. The value shown in FD field can be one of the following cases.
`cwd`: The current working directory, can be read from /proc/[pid]/cwd.
`root`: root directory, can be read from /proc/[pid]/root.
`exe`: program file of this process, can be read from /proc/[pid]/exe.
`mem`: memory mapping information, can be read from /proc/[pid]/maps.
`del`: indicate that the file or link has been deleted. You should show this value if there is a (deleted) mark right after the filename in memory maps.
[0-9]+[rwu]: file descriptor and opened mode.
The numbers show the file descriptor number of the opened file.
The mode "r" means the file is opened for reading.
The mode "w" means the file is opened for writing.
The mode "u" means the file is opened for reading and writing.
`NOFD`: if /proc/[pid]/fd is not accessible. In this case, the values for TYPE and NODE field can be left empty.
`TYPE`: The type of the opened file. The value shown in TYPE can be one of the following cases.
`DIR`: a directory. cwd and root is also classified as this type.
`REG`: a regular file
`CHR`: a character special file, for example
```sh
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Mar 17 17:31 /dev/null
```

`FIFO`: a pipe, for examle
A link to a pipe, e.g.,
```sh
lr-x------ 1 terrynini38514 terrynini38514 64 Mar 17 19:55 5 -> 'pipe:[138394]'
```
A file with p type (FIFO)
```
prw------- 1 root root 0 Mar 17 19:54 /run/systemd/inhibit/11.ref
```
`SOCK`: a socket, for example
```sh
lrwx------ 1 terrynini38514 terrynini38514 64 Mar 17 19:55 1 -> 'socket:[136975]'
```

unknown: Any other unlisted types. Alternatively, if a file has been deleted or is not accessible (e.g., permission denied), this column can show unknown.
`NODE`:
The i-node number of the file
It can be blank or empty if and only if `/proc/[pid]/fd` is not accessible.
`NAME`:
- Show the opened filename if it is a typical file or directory.
- Show pipe:[node number] if it is a symbolic file to a pipe, e.g.,
- l-wx------ 1 ta ta 64 三 8 02:11 91 -> 'pipe:[2669735]'
- Show socket:[node number] if it is a symbolic file to a socket, e.g.,
- lrwx------ 1 ta ta 64 三 8 02:11 51 -> 'socket:[2669792]'
- Append  (deleted) (note the space before the message) to the end of the value if the value for TYPE is del.
- Append  (opendir: Permission denied) if the access to /proc/pid/fd is failed due to permission denied.
- Append  (readlink: Permission denied) if the access to /proc/pid/(cwd|root|exe) is failed due to permission denied.
## Program Arguments
Your program should work without any arguments. In the meantime, your program have to properly handle the following arguments:

- `-c REGEX`: a regular expression (REGEX) filter for filtering command line. For example -c sh would match bash, zsh, and share.
- `-t TYPE`: a TYPE filter. Valid TYPE includes REG, CHR, DIR, FIFO, SOCK, and unknown. TYPEs other than the listed should be considered as invalid. For invalid types, your program have to print out an error message Invalid TYPE option. in a single line and terminate your program.
- `-f REGEX`: a regular expression (REGEX) filter for filtering filenames.
Homework Submission
We will compile your homework by simply typing 'make' in your homework directory. You have to ensure your Makefile produces the executable hw1. Please make sure your Makefile works and the output executable name is correct before submitting your homework.

Please pack your C/C++ code and Makefile into a zip archive. The directory structure should following the following illustration. The id is your student id. Please note that you don't need to enclose your id with the braces.
```sh
{id}_hw1.zip
└── {id}_hw1/
	├── Makefile
	├── hw1.cpp
	└── (any other c/c++ files if needed)
```

Your have to submit your homework via the E3 system. Scores will be graded based on the completeness of your implementation.

## Remarks
Please implement your homework in C or C++.
Using any non-standard libraries and any external binaries (e.g., via system()) are not allowed.
No copycats. Please do not use codes from other (even open sources projects).
We will test your program in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Linux with the default gcc version (9.3.0).
Outputs
Your program has to order the output lines by performing a numeric sort against process ID (PIDs). We will test your program with and without root permission. If an operation does not have sufficient permission to perform, you have to print out Permission denied message.

Run the command without root permission
